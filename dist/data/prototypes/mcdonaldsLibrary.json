   "publisher_summary": "There's an old saying: if you eat a live frog first thing each morning, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that it's probably the worst thing you'll do all day. Using \"eat that frog\" as a metaphor for tackling the most challenging task of your day, the one you are most likely to procrastinate on, but also the one that might have the greatest positive impact on your life, <i>Eat That Frog!</i> shows you how to zero in on these critical tasks and organize your day.You 'll not only get more done faster, but get the right things done. < p > In his trademark high - energy style, acclaimed speaker and best - selling author Brian Tracy cuts to the core of what is vital to effective personal time management: decision, discipline, and determination.He reminds us: \"The purpose of time - management skills, of eating that frog, and getting more done in less time, is to enable you to spend more 'face time' with the people you care about, doing the things that give you the greatest amount of joy in life.\"",
