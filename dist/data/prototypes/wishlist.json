    "publisher_summary": "<p><i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> is the whip-smart fiction debut of Academy Award-nominated actor Jesse Eisenberg. Known for his iconic film roles but also for his regular pieces in the <i>New Yorker</i> and his two critically acclaimed plays, Eisenberg is an emerging literary voice. </p><p>Taking its title from a group of stories that begin the book, <i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> moves from contemporary LA to the dorm rooms of an American college to ancient Pompeii, throwing the reader into a universe of social misfits, reimagined scenes from history, and ridiculous overreactions. In one piece, a tense email exchange between a young man and his girlfriend is taken over by his sister, who is obsessed with the Bosnian genocide (\"The situation reminds me of a little historical blip called the Karadordevo agreement\"); in another, a college freshman forced to live with a roommate is stunned when one of her ramen packets goes missing (\"She didn't have <i>one</i> of my ramens. She had a chicken ramen\"); in another piece Alexander Graham Bell has teething problems with his invention (\"I've been calling Mabel all day, she doesn't pick up! Yes, of course I dialed the right number - two!\"). </p><p>United by Eisenberg's gift for humor and character, the witty pieces collected in <i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> explore the various insanities of the modern world and mark the arrival of a fantastically funny, self-ironic, and original voice. </p>",

My kids are at the age where they are venturing alone now into YA classics. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>What I love most about Chamber of Secrets is how this novel proved that Sorcerer's Stone was NOT just a one-off-wonder. JK Rowling actually had a plan, a progression, and an ability to grow her characters and her series. 'Sorcerer's Stone' was great for its discovery, its newness, its magic. Chamber of Secrets was great because it was the first book of JK Rowling's where I discovered that JK Rowling was the REAL magician.",

This is not fair to us as readers nor both of the authors.  If Paula Hawkins' book doesn't blow you away, then her reputation is sullied and if the next book by Gillian Flynn doesn't surpass &#34;Gone Girl&#34; then she's weak.  Weighty expectations are unfair and produce resentment all around.  Enough of my rant about marketing.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This book is good on it's own merit and the only parallel to &#34;Gone Girl&#34; is the missing girl scenario.  What makes this tale different and fun is the unreliable narrator, Rachel; neither blonde, sleek, beautiful nor sophisticated. She's a hot mess, literally stumbling in a drunken stupor from one cringe-worthy situation to the next. The recently sacked redhead squeezes her pudgy bum into the train seat each day riding her old rail line to spy on her old home now shared by her ex and his new pretty wife & baby.  Along the way she invents names and stories for different houses and people, crossing the line between make-believe and reality only to lead us on a haphazard goose chase to find out where in the world is Meghan. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Read this quirky, odd, humorous, sad, awkwardly embarrassing, and utterly redeemable new novel.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>",

I am so glad that Audible chose three different narrators for Rachel, Anne and Meghan.  It made this story much easier to follow when each scene changed.  Like &#34;Good Girl&#34; none of these characters are candidates for citizen of the year.  In addition, can you rely on their viewpoint?  Rachel's life is a drunken shambles, Anne is the &#34;other woman&#34; and Meghan goes missing and we are not sure why.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>This is a twisty, well plotted mystery that will keep you riveted and guessing to the very end.

Every day she rattles down the track, flashes past a stretch of cozy suburban homes, and stops at the signal that allows her to daily watch the same couple breakfasting on their deck. She\u2019s even started to feel like she knows them. \"Jess and Jason,\" she calls them. Their life\u2014as she sees it\u2014is perfect. Not unlike the life she recently lost.</p> <p>And then she sees something shocking. It\u2019s only a minute until the train moves on, but it\u2019s enough. Now everything\u2019s changed. Unable to keep it to herself, Rachel offers what she knows to the police, and becomes inextricably entwined in what happens next, as well as in the lives of everyone involved. Has she done more harm than good? </p><p>Compulsively readable, <i>The Girl on the Train</i> is an emotionally immersive, Hitchcockian thriller and an electrifying debut.</p>",

        "audible_editors_summary": "<b>Editors Select, January 2015</b> - Like any good book lover, I like to read or listen to a book before I see the film. So when I heard <i>The Revenant</i> was headed to the big screen in 2015 in a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy I knew it had to be my pick for January. Written by Michael Punke (now a Deputy, USTR to the World Trade Organization in Geneva), the book is based on the incredible true story of fur trapper Hugh Glass who was mauled by a bear on an expedition, then robbed and abandoned by the two men who promised to stay by his side. Glass survives the gruesome attack and vows revenge on the men who left him for dead. Westerns are not usually my cup of tea, but I was absolutely hooked by this gritty, suspenseful tale of survival. I can't wait for the film! <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=A1SXRWX03P7HQW\" style=\"text-decoration: none\"><i>&#0151;Sam, Audible Editor</i></a>",

Trapping beaver, they contend daily with the threat of Indian tribes turned warlike over the white men's encroachment on their land, and other prairie foes - like the unforgiving landscape and its creatures. Hugh Glass is among the Company's finest men, an experienced frontiersman and an expert tracker. But when a scouting mission puts him face-to-face with a grizzly bear, he is viciously mauled and not expected to survive. The Company's captain dispatches two of his men to stay behind and tend to Glass before he dies, and to give him the respect of a proper burial. When the two men abandon him instead, taking his only means of protecting himself - including his precious gun and hatchet - with them, Glass is driven to survive by one desire: revenge. With shocking grit and determination, Glass sets out crawling inch by inch across more than 3000 miles of uncharted American frontier, negotiating predators both human and not, the threat of starvation, and the agony of his horrific wounds. In Michael Punke's hauntingly spare and gripping prose, <i>The Revenant</i> is a remarkable tale of obsession, the human will stretched to its limits, and the lengths that one man will go to for retribution. </p>",

In fact, Glen apparently never fired a shot and was killed with Tyrone when a mortar struck the rooftop position they were on. Glen had climbed up to visit with Tyrone after arriving from Tripoli with a rescue team that included two Delta Force Operators (who did not participate in the battle, but received awards for heroism). It details how Kris \"Tonto\" Paronto, Mark \"Oz\" Geist and John \"Tig\" Tiegan (all part of the original response team), fought off wave after wave of attackers and the troubles each of them faced as they took the fight to the attackers.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Explanations of how they heard rumors that it was an attack that was ignited by a Youtube video, and how the operators knew that wasn't the case. How they searched for Stevens to the point of nearly dying themselves from Smoke inhalation, toxic gasses, etc.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>It tells how following the initial assault on the Embassy grounds, most of the fighting then took place at the CIA Compound about a mile away. That is was an organized military style attack, not a bunch of demonstrators, that quickly dialed in and landed three perfectly placed mortars on one rooftop during the battle... again, not an easy task for goat herders.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This book puts you right next to these heroes and the battles they fought with the attackers, their station chief, the flames in the Embassy building and better judgement. I would STRONGLY recommend this book for anyone wanting to know what REALLY happened in Benghazi, Libya on September 11, 2012.",

A team of six American security operators fought to repel the attackers and protect the Americans stationed there. Those men went beyond the call of duty, performing extraordinary acts of courage and heroism, to avert tragedy on a much larger scale. This is their personal account, never before told, of what happened during the 13 hours of that now-infamous attack. </p><p><i>13 Hours</i> sets the record straight on what happened during a night that has been shrouded in mystery and controversy. Written by <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Mitchell Zuckoff, this riveting book takes listeners into the action-packed story of heroes who laid their lives on the line for one another, for their countrymen, and for their country. </p><p><i>13 Hours</i> is a stunning, eye-opening, and intense book - but most importantly, it is the truth. The story of what happened to these men - and what they accomplished - is unforgettable.</p>",

We meet people, date, get into and out of relationships, all with the hope of finding someone with whom we share a deep connection. This seems standard now, but it's wildly different from what people did even just decades ago. Single people today have more romantic options than at any point in human history. With technology, our abilities to connect with and sort through these options are staggering. So why are so many people frustrated? </p><p>Some of our problems are unique to our time. \"Why did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?\" \"Should I go out with this girl even though she listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods? Combos?!\" \"My girlfriend just got a message from some dude named Nathan. Who's Nathan? Did he just send her a photo of his penis? Should I check just to be sure?\" </p><p>But the transformation of our romantic lives can't be explained by technology alone. In a short period of time, the whole culture of finding love has changed dramatically. A few decades ago, people would find a decent person who lived in their neighborhood. Their families would meet, and, after deciding neither party seemed like a murderer, they would get married and soon have a kid, all by the time they were 24. Today people marry later than ever and spend years of their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, a soul mate. </p><p>For years Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at modern romance, but for <i>Modern Romance</i>, the audiobook, he decided he needed to take things to another level. He teamed up with NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massive research project, including hundreds of interviews and focus groups conducted everywhere from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita.</p>",

                "author_name": "Mehra",
                "body": "At first I was hesitant to buy this book as I have read several self help books like Today Matters, Awaken the Giant Within, etc. And I just didnt want to buy another one as after a couple of books the information in them starts getting repetitive and the truth is if you actually do what is in one book it will be more than enough. The only problem is that we read a lot and do not persist in doing what we  learned form the book...or at least thats the case for me.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>But I bough this book anyway as it seemed different and the reviews on it were good. It was worth it. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>In the book, the author talks about habits and how to create new ones and stick to them. He doesn't tell you do this and that to be more productive, rather he tells you how to craete habits and then start doing them naturally without effort or thinking...whatever that habit is. He provides scientific evidence that when an act becomes a habit, your brain does less work to do it! &lt;br/>&lt;br/>He says for a certain action to become a habit, there are three things:&lt;br/>1. A cue that triggers the action&lt;br/>2. Repetition: You have to repeat the action everytime the cue happens&lt;br/>3. Reward: A reward at the end&lt;br/>And so to change the bad habits that you have, you will not ignore the cue that  drove you to that old habit but rather you will act diffrently. In other words, you will satisfy your craving in another way as ignoring it will only solve the problem temporarily and after a while you will go back to your old habits again.&lt;br/>And so you will keep the cue and the reward but change the routine in the middle....but first you need to see what you were really craving. Was it really that chocolate bar you were craving or were you bored at work and wanted a distraction? If it was boredom, then go and socialize instead. Like this you didn't ignore the cue (boredom) or the reward (getting  out of boredom) but you simple replaced the bad habit(chocolate) with a good one (socializing). &lt;br/>But he then states that usually people create habits and stick to them until a crisis or pressure comes. At that moment, people usually go back to their old habits mainly because they do not believe in the new system or the new habit. And that adds the fourth element of creating a habit which is belief - belief in the habit and in something bigger - like God. Believing that there is a God or that there is a higher power that will take you through this hard times is essential to keep you going on and not falling back. This will be specially usefull in bad habits like drinking. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>He then states that people usually try to change everything at once and thus do that for a little while and then get overwhelmed and return back to all their old habits. &lt;br/>And so to stick to a habit and change your life, you need to select a key stone habit. A key stone habit is a habit that when you change it, all other habits will automatically change. For example, if you write a daily food journal - just writing what you eat, you have not decided to eat less or anything else - just writing what you eat down will eventually make you watch what you eat and change it. Consequently, by just focusing on this one habit you encourged other habits. However, you will not be overwhelmed by a sudden lot of change. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>He then talks about grit - which is to keep walking towards your goal for years inspite of challenges and obstacles, and regardless of how long it takes you to achieve it. He says that will power and self discipline are the most important factors for success -  not IQ or anything else. That will power is a habit too. That it is a muscle that can be excercised, that when you have will power you start to change how you think. That you have to practice focusing on goals, writing plans and identifying simple cues and obvious rewards. For example, you should write a plan on how one would act in a specific situation. Specifically what you would do when things go wrong or get tough. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>He also talks about crisis and how people are more open to change during crisis and that this will be a good opportunity to change social habits. &lt;br/>As for the ingredients for social habits:&lt;br/>1. Protest&lt;br/>2. Peer pressure &lt;br/>3. Must be self prepelling.  People  have to be participants and not followers&lt;br/>He talks a lot more about social habits but that is just a summary&lt;br/>&lt;br/>To sum up he says that to create new habits and to change you have to:&lt;br/>1. Decide to work hard. As it a lot of hard work and will not come easily. &lt;br/>2. Identify cue and reward&lt;br/>3. One has to have self control and be self conscious&lt;br/>That habits are what you choose them to be. That they are the unthinking choices that we make everyday. By making them visible we can change them. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Also, he backs up all this by providing examples and scientific evidence.",

It lacks a summary of the main point of each chapter, which would really help drive things home. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>In one chapter I listened to a discussion of brain surgery and a a blow by blow detail of a big surgical error. This story was then displayed as an example of negative habits. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>That sounds OK in theory, but it took the author twenty minutes to get to the point. I felt like most of the meaning of the book got buried in the examples, and there was no clarification on the meat of the information. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>It's narrated well.",

A clear, simple structure, but it may trick readers into skipping parts, especially the last section, in which a pivotal moment in American history is linked to the founding of the MegaChurch (and in the hands of lesser man than Rick Warren, it is a How To for founding a cult).

        "publisher_summary": "<p>A young woman walks into a laboratory. Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed. </p><p>Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern - and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year. </p><p>An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees - how they approach worker safety - and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones. </p><p>What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. They succeeded by transforming habits. </p><p>In <i>The Power of Habit</i>, award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. </p><p>Along the way, we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren\u2019s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation\u2019s largest hospitals, and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death. </p><p>At its core, <i>The Power of Habit</i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. </p><p>Habits aren\u2019t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives.</p>",

THE GRAND DESIGN delivers on promises to explain incomprehensibly abstract concepts in a manner accessible to non scientists.  The topics were discussed thoroughly, and the analagies given helped me to picture the various acrobatics of teeny tiny particles.  The scientific method, it's history, and rocky road to the elegant system of understanding reality we have today, were also described, in terms of &quot;sciences'&quot; own mistakes and ravenously canibalistic culture where truth/evidence/transparency/descriptive and prescriptive powers are valued more than the feelings/reputation of any given scientist.  This book does a great job of explaining WHY some deeply held &quot;values&quot; are fallacious, and based on specious arguments, and can be easily deconstructed.  I enjoyed listening as such seeemingly odd physics were detailed, because the quantum world is so counter intuitive to our macro world.  I recommend this book more so than &quot;A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME&quot;, because this new book is entirely more entertaining and compelling.  It is a lovely addition to the many wonderful books, written by non believers, which popularize science, and more importantly, teach critical thinking.",

It was a great overview of a lot of physics that I already knew through many other readings, but also a great lesson in the history of man's knowledge about the world and universe we live in.  While the authors do overextend themselves to a realm outside of physics when trying to declare the lack of need of God, I share their belief so I appreciated their conclusions.  There will be many knocks on this book for stepping outside their box, but that WAS their point.  While this is a science book written by physicists, it is also their take on the question of the origin of life, the universe, and everything.  Just read the title, it's not called &quot;How Physics Explains the Universe&quot;.",

Despite what you may have seen in the media, they do not rule out the possibility of God. My only warning: Be careful listening to it in traffic. Some of the concepts require a fair deal of vizualization, and I nearly had 3 accidents because I was looking at the pictures in my head instead of the road. Buy it. You'll ejoy it, and you'll be able to harass both the establishment and the clergy with the knowledge you pick up.",

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent \u201cgrand design\u201d of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion\u2014or does science offer another explanation?</p><p>The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet\u2014if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. </p><p>In <i>The Grand Design</i> they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the \u201cmultiverse\u201d\u2014the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.</p><p>Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a \u201cmodel-dependent\u201d theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete \u201ctheory of everything.\u201d If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.</p><p>A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will inform\u2014and provoke\u2014like no other.</p>",
