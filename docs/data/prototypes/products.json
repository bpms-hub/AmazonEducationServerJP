These wonderful stories are done full justice by Jim Dale, whose narration compliments Rowling's lovely characters perfectly. I am so delighted that Rowling has finally allowed the digital versions to be sold on Audible as the cost of them through her website was ridiculous. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>At any rate, if you have not listened to Harry Potter - even if you've read it and seen the films - you will be introduced to Harry, Ron, Hermione and all the denizens of Hogwarts in a different way when you listen to The Sorcerer's Stone. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I can't seen any point in recapping the plot because I just assume everyone has read at least the first two of these books, but I can tell you that listening to them is an &#34;immersive&#34; experience. Of course, that's true of any book, but the richness of Rowling's characters, settings and situations are brought to life, in my opinion, in an entirely different way when you listen to Jim Dale read them to you. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>If  you already love and appreciate the Harry Potter series, you'll rediscover it when you listen.

    "audible_editors_summary": "<b>Editors Select, May 2014</b> - It's been a long time since I've been this excited about a new sci-fi novel, and when I heard Chris Beckett’s <i>Dark Eden</i> had already made a splash in the UK – winning the 2013 Arthur C. Clark award for best novel - I knew I had to listen immediately. What I found was a fascinatingly original story set in a very unique world. Dark Eden is a sunless alien planet populated by strange creatures that was reminiscent to me of deep sea Earth. There lives the Family - the hundreds of direct descendants from the first humans to be marooned there ages ago. The Family never leaves their home in the forest, patiently waiting for the day when Earth will return to take them back home - until one day a young boy named John dares to wonder what's beyond the great expanse they call Snowy Dark. One of the most fascinating thing about this novel was Beckett’s use of language: the Family has evolved with an almost exclusively oral history, giving them a unique English dialect. This novel hit on all the aspects I love in a sci-fi story, including a beautifully imagined world, religious undertones, and complex politics. But at its heart this is a character-driven story about self-awareness and evolving as humans – making for a great listen for any fan of great fiction. <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=A1SXRWX03P7HQW\" style=\"text-decoration: none\"><i>&#0151;Sam, Audible Editor</i></a>",

They are all waiting for rescue, because their parents and grandparents have passed down a plan which was constructed by their ancestors, more than 100 years ago. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Generations ago, 5 earthlings crashed on a strange planet with no sun. Three left, they were to come back with help from earth; Tommy and Angela stayed behind, waiting for their rescue. They become the original parents to a colony of their descendants. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Years of inbreeding, combined with limited knowledge, have addled most of their minds and bodies, but not everyone.  John and his friends are forward thinkers.  This story is about those who dared to ask what if we are stuck here?  Shouldn't we start to live as if we will never be rescued?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Written from several points of view, the story seamlessly allows the reader to understand where the characters stand, and how they developed into their current ways of thinking. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>The ending could be final, but it gives hope for sequels!&lt;br/>  ",

The answer was ‘a lot’. Forgive me if I don’t know the genre well enough to judge whether this is truly a good example of sci-fi, but I loved it.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The story takes place some time in the not too distant future, when humans are able to travel into distant space, but they still have some familiar old technology such as radio, television, electricity and police vehicles. We only know this secondhand, however, because we are told about this technology by ancestors of 3 earth colonists who crash landed there and then formed a ‘fee-amily’ of about 500 people by interbreeding with each other. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>They have heard about radios and television, but never seen them for themselves.&lt;br/>They are very simple souls who live a hunter-gatherer existence living off the exotic flora and fauna of this dark planet. There is no sun, and the only light comes from trees and animals who generate it through their evolved 'lee-anterns’, supplemented by a little bit of starlight and the light from human fires. There is a high incidence of birth deformities in this community, such as hair-lip ('Bat Face') and claw-foot resulting, presumably, from the interbreeding. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>They all believe in a kind of creation story about their ancestors, and harbour a quasi- religious belief that earth will one day return to Dark Eden to fetch them back, even though it is about 150 years since their ancestors landed there. In order not to miss being picked up by earthlings, they all feel obliged to stay close to the original landing spot in a crater on the planet’s surface called ‘Circle Vee-ally’, even though the area has been over-hunted and food is growing too scarce to feed the growing Fee-amily.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>But there is one character, John Red-Lee-Antern, who is different to all the rest. He doesn’t believe that the Fee-amily is destined to stay in this one small part of the planet waiting to be picked up. He wants to go on a dangerous trip over the top of ‘Snowy Dark’ in search of richer pastures. He has the courage and the vision to explore this unknown terrain, with exciting consequences for the rest of the story.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>It is very appealing the way the fee-amily has evolved its own dialect and customs. They have become quite a primitive community, even though they are descended from advanced humans. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>The characterisation and dialogue are very convincing and interesting. I found the book compelling from the beginning to the end and will now be keen to give sci-fi another go. ",

The story is well-known: Martians land on earth, in Woking in Southern England, and quickly set about destroying the British infrastructure and military defenses and crisping via heat ray the humans they don't capture to use as handy blood sources, all as detachedly and efficiently as humans would deal with a colony of ants or wasps. The first person narrator relates all this in a compellingly honest and passionate way. His relationship with the curate is more provocative and terrible than that between Tom Cruise and Tim Robbins in the 2005 movie version by Spielberg. For that matter, the novel, depicting the narrator's attempts to survive and to find his wife, is sparer and cleaner than the film, clotted by Spielberg's corny additions of a little daughter and teenage son into his divorced protagonist's life. Wells' imaginings of the Martian tripod war machines with their terrible heat-ray and poison gas weapons and of their spider-like handling-machines (with their uncanny animation and dexterity) and of the red creeping Martian weeds and of how panicked masses of people would behave are all vivid and morbidly fascinating. Via his Martians, Wells forces us to look again at our actions towards the ???inferior??? species and aboriginal peoples on our own world and also at our ???right??? to survive in an uncaring universe. \r<br />\r<br />Simon Vance does his usual fine job of reading, everything being just right except perhaps that his female voices may verge on the artificially feminine. But all in all this is a great audiobook.",

        "body": "Since scifi is not my preferred genre, I’m rarely tempted to use a valuable credit for space invasions. But the Daily Deal encouraged my curiosity about this classic and I was very well rewarded.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I haven’t seen any of the movie adaptations, but I suspect that any updating of the story to modern times would take away one of the things that made this story so chilling to me, and that was the slow dawning of realization that came over the humans as they faced the unimaginable.  Such an invasion today would be instantly blasted from phone to phone around the world in seconds.   The tension builds as the understanding of the danger occurs to the residents of the English countryside – blooming from amused interest to disbelief, blustery bravado and finally outright panic as the impersonal ruthlessness of the tripod warriors destroys all hope of escape.  The description of man wiping out ants was chillingly apt. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Well’s acute understanding of human nature comes through as he vividly describes the heroics and villainy of panicked mobs, the reliance on or loss of faith, and the strength of will and resourcefulness  to survive.  And for anyone who has tried to actually wipe out ants – it’s never been done.  This human insight makes the story timeless though written well over a century ago. Vance’s reading made it all the more personal and wonderful.&lt;br/>",

        "body": "H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds is apparently one of those literary classics of Science Fiction that only seems to have gotten better with age. It's still bizarre and terrifying to listen to, and this is due in no small part to Simon Vance's incredible narration. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I'd read the book years back, and have seen both cinematic adaptations. I wasn't sure how it would hold-up, but I was completely hooked from the opening minutes. I'm impressed by how full of weird this book is - the Martians and their tripods are some of the most original aliens we are ever likely to read. And some of the scenes and characters - the curate in particular - seem more relevant and upsetting than they did to me when I initially read it.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Vance is an excellent reader in general, and his performance here brings a lot of emotion to this apocalyptic vision. His voice and tone are sobering, a man witnessing the destruction of his civilization, trying to come to grips with it and figure out what (if anything) he is to do next. Vance is really the ideal reader for this one, and he turns in great work here.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>All in all, this is an excellent storytelling experience. Highly recommended if you want a dose of classic Science Fiction.",

The novel begins ominously, as the lone voice of a narrator intones, \"No one would have believed in the last years of the 19th century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's.\" <P> Things then progress from a series of seemingly mundane reports about odd atmospheric disturbances taking place on Mars to the arrival of Martians just outside of London. At first, the Martians seem laughable, hardly able to move in Earth's comparatively heavy gravity, even enough to raise themselves out of the pit created when their spaceship landed. But soon the Martians reveal their true nature as death machines 100 feet tall rise up from the pit and begin laying waste to the surrounding land. Wells quickly moves the story from the countryside to the evacuation of London itself and the loss of all hope as England's military suffers defeat after defeat. <p>With horror, the narrator describes how the Martians suck the blood from living humans for sustenance and how it's clear that man is not being conquered so much as corralled.",

    "audible_editors_summary": "<b>Editors Select, August 2014</b> - Michael Pitre’s debut novel, <i>Fives and Twenty-Fives</i>, is a richly constructed narrative about the Iraq War. Pitre himself is an Iraq war veteran, and his honest portrayal of the war and its aftermath captures the complex emotions held by so many who were both directly and indirectly involved. Told from multiple compelling perspectives, <i>Fives and Twenty-Fives</i> is nothing short of powerful in its unapologetic authenticity. I'm eager to revisit the book in audio with its multi-cast narration, particularly the character of Kateb, whose transformation from Iraqi university student to translator for American soldiers captivated me throughout. <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=A2BTQPD242SY86\" style=\"text-decoration: none\"><i>&#0151;Katie, Audible Editor</i></a>",

        "author_name": "DCinMI",
        "body": "I understand that there are to be 7 books in this series, but as of this writing there are only 5. I listened to them all, one right after the other, so it is difficult for me to review them separately. Besides, I think anyone new to the series should know what they're getting into right up front. However, there are no spoilers here. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I'm going to use the word \"read\" instead of \"listen\" because it's all the same to me and \"read\" is shorter.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>My sons, both of them \"men grown,\" have been nagging me for at least two years to read these books. Recently, they both accosted me about it from different parts of the country on my birthday, so I grudgingly agreed to try the first book. I have now read them all, as I said. My sons have been disinherited several times during the reading process. They had better hope that the last two books come out before I die.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I have read a number of reviews comparing Martin to Tolkien. This might be true if Tolkien had been a warped, sadistic bastard who enjoyed tormenting his readers. During the course of reading these books, I have called Martin everything but a good guy. Lucifer, Beelzebub, and Spawn of Satan top the list, along with accompanying adjectives. But I read all the books and am biting my nails waiting for the next one. True to his nature, however, Martin is making no promises about when that will be. Judging from the spacing of these first 5 books, I may have no fingers left by the time book 6 hits the presses. (This would help me relate better to some of his characters, I guess.)&lt;br/>&lt;br/>So, for those of you who have not yet begun this series: If you are very squeamish, you'd better not start. There is a lot of torture, violence, explicit sex, and explicit violent sex. Even worse, there's some really bad language. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>It is set in a world that seems to be based on Medieval England, but is not England nor any other place on this earth. The number of characters and story lines that are converging on each other seems daunting at first glance, but I was surprised at how easily I could keep the major ones straight in my head.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>There are some characters that you will love and others that you will love to hate, and still others that you will hate to love. Some of them you will hate and then come to love or pity, and the other way around, too. Some of them, mostly Tyrion Lannister, are very witty and humorous no matter what the situation, so that provides a little relief sometimes. Some of them you will forget about entirely, as a whole book might go by before they pop up again.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>If you like to feel safe and secure when reading a book, this series is not for you. Nothing is sacred, no one is safe. Bad things happen to good people, and vice versa. If I had been reading a paper book, I would have a lot of holes in my walls from repeatedly throwing the books against them. However, reading them has given me plenty of practice climbing the walls. (Unfortunately, as a woman, I would still not be able to become a Black Brother.) No one is happy in any of the seven kingdoms. The only joy comes from vengeance or, more rarely, justice. I hate books like that! But I read all the books and am biting my nails waiting for the next one.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I have given the series 5 stars because I could not stop reading once I had started, no matter how angry it made me. I would never have read these books if my sons had not hounded me into it. But wait--no--I have no sons. That was that other woman who lived before she embarked on the torturous journey that is Game of Thrones.",

The history of these kingdoms is expertly blended into the plot, so that you effortlessly become emersed into the world.  I can't overstate the skill with which the author draws the reader into his world.  It feels as if this land, with its people, traditions and history is as real as our own.  \r<br />\r<br />Magic does exist in this world, but it is rare.  It is used to color the plot, not to dominate it.  There are hints of other races, but varieties of humans are all we encounter.  There is some profanity, but it's fairly rare and in context.  There is some sexual content.  I wouldn't recommend this book for children.\r<br />\r<br />Large sections of the plot revolve around the \"palace intrigue\" of the King, his family and the Lords.  This is a book about the nobles of this realm and, as the title suggests, the high stake games they play for power.  The characters in the book are deep, colorful and simply splendid.  Their lives have a depth to them that few authors accomplish.  I confess that, when not reading the book, I actually thought about them during the day and laid awake wondering about them at night.  In the audio version, the narrator does a wonderful job of giving voice to these vivid characters.\r<br />\r<br />The plot has numerous twists and turns.  Sometimes I think the author intentionally speculates about what the reader would expect in the plot of a fantasy novel, and then does something completely different.  I gave up trying to predict what would happen, and decided to just enjoy the ride.  However, there is an overall \"master\" plot that is slowly unveiled in this and subsequent books.\r<br />\r<br />If you enjoy fantasy, this is a must read.  Even if you usually don't like fantasy, you may very enjoy this one.",

I'm talking \"hours of theorizing on a whiteboard after each episode\" obsessed. So when I heard that A.G. Riddle's new book <i>Departure</i> was drawing comparisons to my favorite show, I knew I had to listen. I was pleased to find that while there are some obvious similarities - a plane crash, a mystery, characters who are not what they seem, etc. - the similarities stop there, and Riddle's story quickly takes on its own identity with a unique, tantalizing mystery and plenty of action. Nicola Barber and Scott Aiello are an amazing cast for this book, which shifts perspectives between a male and female lead. Fast-paced, intriguing, and smart, I encourage all my fellow <i>Lost</i>-ies to check this out. <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=A1SXRWX03P7HQW\" style=\"text-decoration: none\"><i>&#0151;Sam, Audible Editor</i></a>",

To tell the truth, I didn't know what to expect when I started it but what I got was an amazing experience. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I'm not going to get into the plot in case I inadvertently spoil something so I'll just get right into what I thought. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Harper is such an amazing Heroine. I loved that she was a writer!! Flight 305 is her first time in first class, which is where she meets Nick. I loved her voice and her thoughts. Despite being terrified when the crash happens, she still does whats needed with no hesitation. I loved her strength and her inherent niceness. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Nick was so mysterious at the start. We didn't get a sense of what he did for a living and I thought he was maybe military. He was so strong, brave and dependable the whole way through the story. I really liked his character and was thrilled to see him show his feelings for Harper! &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Plot wise I found it to be so captivating and intriguing. The plane crashes and no one comes to the passengers rescue, which is weird, add in a barren place with very little life, a rebuilt Stone Henge and a London that's abandoned and you have the makings of a phenomenal book, and it was! I started reading (well listening) and I couldn't stop. There is so many twists and turns that you will be turning the pages as fast as you can to see what happens.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Anyway, I absolutely loved everything about this book. Both the plot and the characters were well written and developed. From it's intrinsic and intriguing plot to it's wonderfully written story, Departure is a must read. If this book is any indication of his work, then I can not wait to read more by him. Amazing.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I listened to the audio and it was fantastic. Both narrators did a brilliant job with the story. They gave it their all and it showed. They drew me into the story and made me a part of it. As I was listening to it, it played out like a movie in my head and I loved it. Highly recommend. &lt;br/>",

    "audible_editors_summary": "<b>Editors Select, October</b> - Bryan Cranston is turning in one of the great television performances as Walter White on the Emmy Award-winning <i>Breaking Bad</i>, so needless to say, I was thrilled to hear that he'd be narrating Tim O'Brien's classic <i>The Things They Carried</i>. I first experienced the book in high school, and to revisit it now with such a gifted performer is an absolute treat. Cranston fully inhabits O'Brien's collection of semi-autobiographical stories about the Vietnam War and brings to it a sense of experience and remembrance as though he were actually there. I've only heard a sample so far, but I'd already consider this one of the top audiobook performances of the year. <a href=\"http://www.audible.com/review-by-author?customerID=A304X14T2SAP4O\" style=\"text-decoration: none\"><i>&#0151;Chris, Audible Editor</i></a>",

        "body": "Like voices from the grave, devastatingly profound, and haunting.  A review would be inappropriate, but my experience with this book was probably similar to other readers that were very young teens during the height of the Viet Nam war.  Though I wore one of those MIA bracelets, sent neighbors and friend's older brothers off, went to Country Joe and the Fish concerts and yelled out the FISH cheer, I was young, distant, and naïve, and could only marginally intellectualize the atrocities and the nightly tally of deaths.  Listening to Cranston narrate these stories gives faces to the words; the soldiers become flesh and blood -- not just characters and chapters.  Their candid stories and Cranston's seriously brilliant interpretations were so achingly real that I could not listen long without pausing, or just stopping my device for a breather.  (It took me 2 weeks to get through this.)  This would be a much easier read, but hardly better; Cranston is able to convey the emotion, every chuckle, every hope, every pain, every horror.  It's not always the obvious that is difficult to hear; the slaughter of the water buffalo wasn't half as savage as the fundamental experience that nurtured the attack... it's listening to the innocence and promise in these young soldiers as it ebbs away.  It's looking back through the all-seeing eyes of retrospection and time,  and probably also adding *mother* to the list of sister, daughter, girlfriend, neighbor.   A vivid reminder of the fragility of life and the true cost of war.  Like others have mentioned, there are several books concerning wars that give you that *boots-on-the-ground* feel, but this one, especially as it is performed here, is the emotional experience--to the degree that it can be shared.

There is something about Tim O'Brien's second (after 'Going After Cacciato') war masterpiece that just gets me. It is one of my favorite [I know, I know favorite isn't the right word and if I had more time, I'd figure out a better term] war novels ever. I love how O'Briend both masters and subverts the form. I love how he bends the reader through time and space. How O'Brien messes with the idea of what a true war story really is. This novel, along with 'Dispatches' by Kerr and 'Matterhorn' by Marlantes, infuses the Vietnam War with its own mass, a specific gravity and real tangible gravity. These fictional stories seem almost to be as true as any nonfiction books written about the War.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>While I haven't been to war, both my brothers and a brother-in-law that have come back from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and the burdens they all returned with seem to reflect in this novel.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Finally, I'm not sure how they hooked Bryan Cranston for this narration, but it might just be my favorite narration EVER. Sir Anthony Hopkins nailed it when he wrote a note to Cranston about 'Breaking Bad':&lt;br/>&lt;br/>___&lt;br/>&lt;br/>That kind of work/artistry is rare, and when, once in a while, it occurs, as in this epic work, it restores confidence.&lt;br/> &lt;br/>You and all the cast are the best actors I’ve ever seen.&lt;br/> &lt;br/>That may sound like a good lung full of smoke blowing. But it is not. It’s almost midnight out here in Malibu, and I felt compelled to write this email.&lt;br/> &lt;br/>Congratulations and my deepest respect. You are truly a great, great actor&lt;br/>___&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Let me just add to and mimic the great Sir Anthony Hopkins. You Bryan are the best narrator I've ever HEARD.     ",

Tim O'Brien is a master of descriptive writing. A reader would have to have serious cognitive deficits not to get pulled in and inundated in the stories. It wasn't until I listened to the audio version, narrated flawlessly by Bryan Cranston, that I noticed the voluptuous poetry of his language.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The book is an anthology of stories about the Vietnam War. Bound together by the theme of what is carried, it opens with the very literal list of what the men in his platoon carried and broadens out into the emotional scars, the guilt, the sense of loss, fear, unrequited love, of brotherhood and of the deadly numbness that is carried on the soul.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I was immensely grateful to encounter this book again.

      "\"O'Brien's haunting collection of connected stories about the Vietnam War is more alive than ever in this narration. Bryan Cranston's resonant, sometimes formal, performance often leaves the listener reeling. Cranston's voice is deep and patient, laying back to let the characters' collective pain take the fore. Memorable scenes include a man's receipt of his draft notice in \"On the Rainy River,\" battle scenes in \"The Man I Killed,\" and aspects of the war's aftermath in \"Speaking of Courage.\" In all the works, Cranston offers a measured, compassionate voice. O'Brien's stories emphasize the importance of telling the truth of war stories, and Cranston's respect for his intent is clear and comforting. At times, his sonorous tone is hypnotic, but this is more an asset than a liability. All the better to make the listener feel.\" (<i>AudioFile</i>)"

    "publisher_summary": "<p>This modern classic and <i>New York Times</i> best seller was a finalist for both the 1990 Pulitzer Prize and National Book Critics Circle Award and has become a staple of American classrooms. Hailed by <i>The New York Times</i> as \"a marvel of storytelling\", <i>The Things They Carried</i>’s portrayal of the boots-on-the-ground experience of soldiers in the Vietnam War is a landmark in war writing. Now, three-time Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston, star of the hit TV series <i>Breaking Bad</i>, delivers an electrifying performance that walks the book’s hallucinatory line between reality and fiction and highlights the emotional power of the spoken word.</p><p>The soldiers in this collection of stories carried M-16 rifles, M-60 machine guns, and M-79 grenade launchers. They carried plastic explosives, hand grenades, flak jackets, and landmines. But they also carried letters from home, illustrated Bibles, and pictures of their loved ones. Some of them carried extra food or comic books or drugs. Every man carried what he needed to survive, and those who did carried their shattering stories away from the jungle and back to a nation that would never understand.</p><p>This audiobook also includes an exclusive recording “The Vietnam in Me,” a recount of the author’s trip back to Vietnam in 1994, revisiting his experience there as a soldier 25 years before, read by Tim O’Brien himself. </p><p><i>The Things They Carried</i> was produced by Audible Studios in partnership with Playtone, the celebrated film and television production company founded by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman, and producer of the award-winning series <i>Band of Brothers, John Adams</i>, and <i>The Pacific</i>, as well as the HBO movie <i>Game Change</i>.</p>",

Out here, a dark-skinned woman's traditional hair color is honey blonde\"). \"Player\" tells the story of Kaling being seduced and dumped by a female friend in LA (\"I had been replaced by a younger model. And now they had matching bangs\"). In \"Unlikely Leading Lady\", she muses on America's fixation with the weight of actresses (\"Most women we see onscreen are either so thin that they're walking clavicles or so huge that their only scenes involve them breaking furniture\"). And in \"Soup Snakes\", Kaling spills some secrets on her relationship with her ex-boyfriend and close friend B. J. Novak (\"I will freely admit: my relationship with B. J. Novak is weird as hell\"). </p><p>Mindy turns the anxieties, the glamour, and the celebrations of her second coming of age into a laugh-out-loud funny collection of essays that anyone who's ever been at a turning point in their life or career can relate to. And those who've never been at a turning point can skip to the parts where she talks about meeting Bradley Cooper. </p>",

Thanks for working with the publisher to fix a 4 minute gap, which while obviously an easy thing to do, had me worried for a while that it wouldn't be done in the short term. This relatively rapid response is much appreciated.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I think Studs Terkel would be proud. The various performers' interpretation of the text made the messages from the witnesses much more varied, both in voice and in the message. This makes it feel more like independent witnesses  than in the original texts, and the emotion in some of the performances was much more moving. Some of the standouts for me included the K9 trainer, the feral young lady being treated and acting out the incident that orphaned her around age 4, Sinclair as acted by Alan Aldo, the performance of Redecker, and the Chinese submariner. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>",

The Martian is absolutely brilliant.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>What surprised me the most was how funny the book was.  I mean that in the humorous, laughing out loud, sense.  In the midst of a nail biting hard science-fiction novel there were moments of incredible levity.  I think it added a huge amount to the book.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Weir clearly spent a huge amount of time working on the math and reality basis of his scenarios; fantastically executed.  The story never lagged, never lost my attention.  Incredibly well done. Top three listens in the past year.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I can't say enough good things about this listen.

Mark Watney, an astronaut who is part of an early Mars mission has been left for dead as his crew-mates were forced to abort their mission. Mark however has survived that initial catastrophe and is forced to go \"Robinson Crusoe\" to survive on a world intent on his demise. Eventually, NASA figures out that Watney is still kicking, but there is little they can do to assist. Watney battles the odds and works his way through one creative solution after another to survive and escape his potential fate as the first human casualty on Mars.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The time frame is the near future with little or no \"new\" science. The tale can become a bit \"geeky\" with explanations and calculations, but that is a major appeal of the story. Weir succeeds in crafting a believable series of events that create dramatic tension that ebbs and flows from start to finish. Watney is never out of the woods (or craters), but every new situations just comes out of nowhere. All along, Watney's composure and humor makes for an endearing character as he relates his experiences in a diary fashion. The supporting cast of Earth-side NASA personnel and Watney's Mars crew-mates are realistically portrayed with banter that comes off as genuine.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>The narration is simply outstanding with an excellent range of voices and a tone that matches the tension inherent throughout the story. This will be a quick listen as the writing stye and delivery make for a can't put down quality.",

It is different from the more typical science fiction. It is actually science AND fiction, combined with lots of humor and suspense. For me, it has everything !  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I was initially disturbed when I heard the narrator's voice and reading style.  It did not seem to fit the Mark Watney I read about and knew.  However, as the book progressed, I think Bray slid comfortably into the role and did a masterful job of capturing the personality of our hero.  He certainly added to the listening pleasure.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This book contains lots of technical jargon and hard science, yet it was put into simple enough terms so that I could easily follow the gist of what was going on.  I would think this story would appeal not only to sci-fi loving engineers but to anyone who enjoys contemporary, realistic science-based fiction which, unfortunately, can be difficult to find during this period of  zombie and vampire mania. And did I mention the humor?&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Very highly recommended! ",

He is a witty genius exploring life experiences for humorous, thought provoking, and snarky effect.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This book however produced fewer laugh-out-loud moments instead turning out the occasional chuckle and a few smiles.  Listening is like visiting an old friend who doesn't have much new to share; maybe the well is dry for now.  A full length book should have been replaced with an article or two in the New Yorker.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>The transition music was long and eerie, not in keeping with the tone for the content.  Also, his delivery wasn't as fervent and immediate as in earlier performances.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Still love David, and am not frustrated I used my credit.  My advice to those who enter is this...don't expect the same initial high from his earlier work and enjoy the nostalgia.  His body of work is phenomenal and am hopeful for future writings.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>",

    "publisher_summary": "<p>A masterful, intensely suspenseful novel about a reader whose obsession with a reclusive writer goes far too far - a book about the power of storytelling, starring the same trio of unlikely and winning heroes King introduced in <i>Mr. Mercedes</i>. </p><p>\"Wake up, genius.\" So begins King's instantly riveting story about a vengeful reader. The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasn't published a book for decades. Morris Bellamy is livid, not just because Rothstein has stopped providing books but because the nonconformist Jimmy Gold has sold out for a career in advertising. Morris kills Rothstein and empties his safe of cash, yes, but the real treasure is a trove of notebooks containing at least one more Gold novel. </p><p>Morris hides the money and the notebooks, and then he is locked away for another crime. Decades later a boy named Pete Saubers finds the treasure, and now it is Pete and his family that Bill Hodges, Holly Gibney, and Jerome Robinson must rescue from the ever-more deranged and vengeful Morris when he's released from prison after 35 years. </p><p>Not since <i>Misery</i> has King played with the notion of a reader whose obsession with a writer gets dangerous. <i>Finders Keepers</i> is spectacular, heart-pounding suspense, but it is also King writing about how literature shapes a life - for good, for bad, forever. </p>",
