I'm sorry... but it is just corny.  Stuff that is considered classics from the 50's (give or take a decade) would be considered just plain BAD if written today, in my opinion.  But if this book were written and released today, I think it would still be good - very good.  This is why I think it was just way ahead of it's time, like most of H.G.'s stuff. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>It was fun reading a book written in the era of 1897.  It's not historical fiction set in the late 19th century, it was actually written back then and was the way things were.  This added to the \"coolness\" of the book.  But yet, like I said, it isn't the corny/bad stuff that you might expect from \"old/classic scifi.\"  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>I had read the first 1/3 of the book a year ago (having always wanted to read it) but got side tracked.  I picked up the audio book here for 50 cents and was well worth it.  A great story and a great listen! &lt;br/>",

                    "body": "On the fourth day of February a \"stranger [falls] out of infinity into Iping Village\" in the Sussex countryside and rents a room at the local inn. His body swathed in clothes, his face wrapped in white bandages, his eyes hidden behind a pair of big blue spectacles, he cuts a bizarre figure. The local \"yokels\" speculate that he must have suffered some kind of accident. Or that he must be a disguised criminal on the run from the police. Or an ashamed mixed-race piebald hiding his appearance. Or an anarchist working on bombs. Or a lunatic. He claims that he's an \"experimental investigator.\" Surely he's unpleasant and irritable, possessing \"A bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite and kill in his mouth,\" upsetting dogs and boys, and rebuffing all attempts to get to know him with curses so that he may be left undisturbed to do his work. No one even knows his name. About when wags begin walking round the village imitating the stranger by pulling down the brims of their hats and pulling up the collars of their coats and kids begin singing a Bogey Man song whenever they see the stranger, events take a surreal turn when the vicar's house is burgled and the locals put two and two together and send the constable to arrest the stranger, who then disrobes and disappears, for, it turns out, he is the Invisible Man.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Most of H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man (1897) concerns the efforts of \"the writer\" to collate and interpret the testimony of various witnesses to the Invisible Man's \"reign of terror\" in the British countryside after the fact. Told from the points of view of countryside denizens like the proprietress of the inn and her husband, the village clock-jobber, general practitioner, reverend, and constable, and even a bachelor tramp, much of the story is a mysterious comedy of class or manner or place. When we finally learn the stranger's name and get his story from his own mouth over half way through, the tale shifts into a study of the alienated mad scientist. Even this is at a remove, however, for his monologue is narrated from the point of view of his university acquaintance Dr. Kemp, who interrupts his story now and then with questions and comments. Wells thus distances us from his scientist until, perhaps, the end of the climax of the short novel. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>The Invisible Man explores themes that appear elsewhere in Wells' work: unknown wonders and terrors in the world/universe caused or explained by science may appear at any moment; people fear extraordinary things; men of science who cut themselves off from community become \"inhuman\"; \"contemporary society\" is marred by \"desecrated fields\" and \"dank, squalid respectability and . . . sordid commercialism.\" It is interesting to read the novel with Wells' great short story \"In the Country of the Blind,\" in which a sighted man enters a village of blind people and thinks to rule them, while here an invisible man thinks at first that his condition will give him wonderful advantages over the common run of sighted humanity, permitting him to perpetrate any crime and to do anything he wants. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Perhaps Wells stacks the deck against his scientist. If he had become invisible in the summer instead of the winter, if he'd been a man of calmer temper, if he'd used a different palliative than strychnine, if he'd had more money, if he'd found a less \"miserable tool\" than the wonderfully named Thomas Marvel, if he'd met Dr. Kemp earlier, and so on, things might have turned out differently. But because the brilliant man is self-centered, irritable, anti-social, and amoral and has become \"ruled by a fixed idea\" (that his experiments are the only reality), has \"lost his human sympathy,\" has come to believe that \"the common conventions of humanity\" like not robbing people in their own homes \"are all very well for common people,\" and has imagined schemes for using the \"commoners\" around him instead of for improving their lives, for all those reasons Wells relishes making things difficult for his scientist. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>As in most of his work, Wells' writing here is concise, clear, amusing, terrifying, and literary. He provides reality-establishing scientific explanations involving optics, physics, dynamos, and chemicals for invisibility. He writes comical and vivid descriptions: \"His mottled face was apprehensive, and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity.\" He applies irony liberally: \"'An invisible man is a man of power.' He stopped for a moment to sneeze violently.\" And he is capable of harrowing prose: \"Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was, I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of 'Mercy! Mercy!' that died down swiftly to a sound like choking.\"&lt;br/>&lt;br/>James Adams reads the audiobook perfectly.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>People interested in the history of science fiction (this is one of the first sf stories about invisibility), in studies of criminal intellectual pride, or in compact philosophical novels, should read this book.&lt;br/>",

Lizbeth is an awesome character and, thanks to him, she's going to be around a little longer! &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Personally, I didn't like this book as much as the first three, but that stems from my own personal taste and, perhaps, stupidity rather than from Lagercrantz's writing.  For one, I would have liked a few less characters to keep straight.  I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I got confused with who was who several times.  Second, although Lizbeth definitely plays a major role in the story, I would have preferred more of her.  (Yes, I'm a fan).  And, third, while I normally do not enjoy violence, I've come to expect it in this series and actually would have liked more of it in this book.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>On the positive side, the plot is thrilling and complex, and it was wonderful to spend time with Lizbeth and Mikael again.  Thankfully, their characters have not changed one bit!  The addition of an autistic boy character was very interesting, and I loved the deeper insight into Lizbeth's childhood and the dark relationship she has with her sister.  The book doesn't end with a bang, but everything is explained and it's a nice ending.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>PERFORMANCE -  Simon Vance delivers his usual awesome performance and lends continuity to the series.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>OVERALL - As always, there is some violence and cursing, but no sex scenes this time.  Recommended for anyone who loves The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I hope the criticism Lagercrantz is receiving for this sequel doesn't dissuade him from continuing our beloved series...",

                "body": "The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web, the continuation of the deceased Stieg Larsson\u2019s the Millennium Series, better known as the The Girl . . . With the Dragon Tattoo, Who Played With Fire, and Kicked the Hornet\u2019s Nest, is very good but not yet to the level of its predecessors.  Stiag Larson created and wrote the first three installations of the Millennium Series publication, but passed before his writing drew popular and scholarly cliam.  So, the present title is authorized by Larsson\u2019s heirs\u2019, as a continuation of his novels, as allegedly plotted out by Larsson before his untimely death.  They are written now by David Lagercrantz, himself a well published and successful Swedish mystery novelist.  The book, the fourth in the Millennium Series is a wonderful murder/espionage/crime syndicate enigmatic story.    Furthermore, the tale is told so well it is very difficult not to read in one sitting.  A good work and recommended.  Yet, . . . &lt;br/>&lt;br/> . .  when compared to Stieg Larsson\u2019s prior works, the present installation, Spider\u2019s Web is without the geometric depth found in the earlier plots.  The peculiarities of the interlacing histories of the individual characters are not presented with the same, \u201coh my gosh, can you believe that twist in the plot\u201d?   A twist that always intrigued the reader in the earlier works because although improbable they were nevertheless believable given how well the story was put together and told.  That characteristic in not present in Spider\u2019s Web.&lt;br/>The story does give us back our old friends, Lisbeth Salander, Mikael Blomkvist, Erika Berger and a cameo by Plague.  Wonderful to visit with them again.  Did not want to let them go and maybe now we can have them as friends for ten more novels?  Yet, like this summer\u2019s revisit with Atticus (Go Set a Watchman, Harper Lee), one can never redo those unique pasts.  The present versions of Lisbeth and Mikael are not the full bodied characters Larsson made, yet, they are still deployable, employable and interesting.  Just not larger than life any longer.  Though, I do not feel Lisbeth and Mikael\u2019s special relationship was demonstrated whatsoever in this novel.&lt;br/>  &lt;br/>The story is about super hacking, and of course, this is all engineered by Lisbeth to bring about the better good.  The story also ties back into her past, specifically her evil father\u2019s criminal empire, which she was able to put an end to in the trilogy.  Yet, effluents of his past remain and seek Lisbeth\u2019s demise.  The hacking that initiates the story and Lisbeth\u2019s family past dovetail to produce a potentially terrific story.  All this is spiced up by the introduction of a savant syndrome child whose prodigious capacities blend uniquely with Lisbeth\u2019s genius.   The story is good, the telling is good and the unfolding is good, but less than it could have been.  At some points just too many people are introduced and it makes it difficult to follow who is who from what organization and why are they added to the plot.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Nevertheless, not a Stieg Larson but definitely a Swedish mystery lover\u2019s read.  This is definitely the only time I have found Simon Vance\u2019s presentation less than great.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>We are told by the media that Larsson\u2019s lifelong significant other lady friend, someone who was with him as he created his characters and plots, was not given opportunity to participate in prolongation of the series.  She was not a legal inheritor and not permitted to guide the follow along series because Larsson\u2019s brother and father, his inheritors, did not want to share the bounty.  Someone should have pointed out to them; long time loving mates share an \u00e9lan and perception of the original Lisbeth tales that perhaps no one, not even an editor may share.  This may have been quite stupid. If Larsson\u2019s life mate was there when he created our loving characters the story may have had an insight which we do not and now will never have.   ",

        "audible_editors_summary": "<p>Charles Dickens's classic of the French Revolution is expertly dramatized by Simon Vance. It's also a grand romance. Charles Darnay, the French \u00e9migr\u00e9 who relinquishes his title in disgust at the poverty wrought upon the peasants by the titled class, and Sydney Carton, the world-weary drunken London barrister, both love Lucie, the daughter of the unjustly imprisoned Dr. Alexandre Manette. Vance will have listeners weeping as Carton greets Madame Guillotine with some of the most famous lines in literature. Carton's depression and ultimate redemption are crystal clear; Madame Defarge, with her clicking knitting needles, takes on appropriate menace; and Jarvis Lorry, the reliable \"man of business,\" loves Lucie as if she were his daughter.</p>",

I am living in Paris for a few years so I have been trying to listen to some European classics. I just didn't realize/appreciate the gravity of the French Revolution until I came to live here. As an American, I just don't have much appreciation for world history...I'm getting some! The opening lines of this novel are iconic...they are familiar even to me...if I was a contestant on Jeopardy I would not have put Dicken's poetry with this tale...I feel so much better prepared now for any future contests. The narration is outstanding. I tend to favor male narrators as I find very few women's voices do justice to male roles, and this novel is dominated by male characters. As with the few books I have read placed in this time period, it is a tale full of extreme sadness...at times...hopelessness. To my limited view, it captures the terror of the French revolution all too well. If time travel becomes possible at some point, avoid Paris during the French revolution because no one was safe from Madame Guillotine.Dickens is able to take a sad storyline and somewhat give us a happy ending. If you are a fan of Dickens, this is definitely a story you will want to hear as he takes this time in history and creates a timeless tale.",

Add the great narration that we've come to expect from Simon Vance and you have an Audible Classic that one will thoroughly enjoy.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Charles Dickens did a great job when he wrote this book and the sales of book over time does tell you why. This is one of those timeless classics that you can't help but enjoy. The pace of the book itself languishes a bit and will not be appreciated by everyone. The slower pace however is used with good effect as it is used to set up the book pretty well. If you're a fan of good imagery, it is painted very well in these 'slow' moments. When the pace does pick up however, it picks up fast and extremely well with a lot of exciting action. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>The novel talks about the plight of the French commons brought upon by the French ruling class, the subsequent revolution and then the often times senseless revenge the French commons take on the former French ruling class. Parallel to this is also mentioned life in London during the same period. It follows the lives of several protagonists through these events.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Simon Vance does a very great job bringing life to the story. I found myself enjoying his narration quite well. This book had a relatively large cast and and the way he was able to bring life to each individual character is impressive to say the least.",

Finally released, he is reunited with his daughter, Lucie, who despite her French ancestry has been brought up in London.

When revolution breaks out in Paris, Darnay returns to the city to help an old family servant, but there he is arrested because of the crimes committed by his relations.

I recently re-saw the mini-series and immediately wanted to experience the unabridged original again.  The book was even better than I had remembered.  The prose, the characters, and the story are all superior.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I was surprised there were quite a few subtle nuances in the story that I had not picked up on in my pervious several readings.  I enjoyed this immensely as this is rare in all but the best of fiction.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Unfortunately the rest of this series does not live up to this powerful beginning, but not to worry, Dune stands alone. I strongly recommend this book even if you really disliked the movie.  There are images and characters in this novel that have affected me strongly since my childhood and influenced me as a person.  There are few works of fiction that I both enjoyed and appreciated as much as Dune.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>I generally don\u2019t like music or sound effects in an audio book, but here the sound-effect are light and don\u2019t distract from the story.  The narration, although not perfect, is quite good. This audio edition does the work justice.&lt;br/>",

                "body": "WOW!!  The narration in this book is always good with segments that are GREAT.  There were some complaints about the changing of accents or voices.  I think of this in these terms.  The normal narrator goes along telling you the story, and then at times there is an 'enhanced' scene, a scene where the voices are really acted out,  usually with several different voice actors. I think of this as a picture in a book, this enhanced scene has a different set of voices because of the change in actors, but at these times you are also sucked into the story a bit more.  Eventually the enhanced scene ends and the story is passed back to the standard narrator.  As for the sound effects and the music, I think they all add to the richness of the story.  I was never distracted from the story because of them.  When I first heard the change between the 'enhanced' scenes and the standard narration, I was a little confused, but I quickly recognized the extra enjoyment I got from these enhanced scenes, and looked at them as a positive factor rather than seeing them as a negative.  If I had known, going into the recording that it happened this way, I don't think I would have been confused at all.    I think if you go into this thinking that the story was recorded with an excellent narrator, then the producers went back and 'enhanced' certain scenes for your enjoyment, you will be able to fully appreciate the wonderfulness of this recording.",

Rowling, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&lt;br/>&lt;br/>Reviewing these books again as they've come out on Audible has been a thrill. My kids are at the age where they are venturing alone now into YA classics. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>What I love most about Chamber of Secrets is how this novel proved that Sorcerer's Stone was NOT just a one-off-wonder. JK Rowling actually had a plan, a progression, and an ability to grow her characters and her series. 'Sorcerer's Stone' was great for its discovery, its newness, its magic. Chamber of Secrets was great because it was the first book of JK Rowling's where I discovered that JK Rowling was the REAL magician.",

Rowling, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&lt;br/>&lt;br/>It is still hard for me to separate the first three Harry Potter novels. I read them together and they have always seemed, not distinct, but still unique in the series. It was about 1998/1999 when early signs of Potter-mania were being felt. There was a sense that this was not going to be a small thing. I bought the three novels. My wife hadn't heard anything of them and after, it was all she wanted to talk about. The cat was out of the bag and the cult of JK Rowling was taking form.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This book might also be my personal favorite among the three. The first was amazing because it was the first. The second was impressive because it showed how deep and far JK Rowling had planned this series. The third knocked me out because I found out how much I could love secondary characters in children's literature. The back stories and secondary characters MAKE this book.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>When these books first dropped, I was comparing them to books by CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, and T.H. White. Who knew that in a short decade we would be using JK Rowling as the measuring stick for them ALL? ",

Rowling, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&lt;br/>&lt;br/>8 July 2000. By this time. everyone was on the Harry Potter train. Steven King was reviewing Goblet of Fire for the New York Times, and news was out that they were going to be making Harry Potter into a movie. This book was released simultaneously in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury and in the United States by Scholastic. It was a phenomenon. It won the Hugo. We all felt it. Grandmas who didn't read kids books were having the first three foisted on them.&lt;br/>&lt;br/>This was also when I discovered how funny JK Rowling was. Don't get me wrong she was funny before, but Goblet of Fire pushed not only the gas on length, but also her sharp wit. As the team (Harry, Ron and Hermione) is growing up, so the humor gets a little richer and the plot starts getting a bit darker. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>",

Only wizards who are over seventeen are allowed to enter - but that doesn't stop Harry dreaming that he will win the competition. Then at Hallowe'en, when the Goblet of Fire makes its selection, Harry is amazed to find his name is one of those that the magical cup picks out. He will face death-defying tasks, dragons and Dark wizards, but with the help of his best friends, Ron and Hermione, he might just make it through - alive! </p>",

Voldemort is back, clues to future events are hidden in the text, important events occur, important characters in the war are introduced, and key information is given.  Harry's story moves on dramatically and he grows up significantly, turning from angry, angsty, troubled, and misunderstood kid, to the character he must become to take on what lies before him. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>As usual Jim Dale's narration is spot on. I'm always amazed at how he is able to create so many different characters and keep their voices consistent throughout the entire series. &lt;br/>&lt;br/>After listening to these books on CD for years, and then having to rip each of the disks to the computer to be able to listen to them digitally, I'm extremely excited to be able to listen to one of my favorite series's so easily.  For a bit of comparison I pulled out those discs and found that this audiobook alone consisted of 23 separate discs consisting of 10 or more tracks each and cost $75 at the when it was first released.

Rowling, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince &lt;br/>&lt;br/>Probably my favorite book in the series. I think this is JK Rowling at the peak of her writing, confidence, and strength. She is dealing with older protagonists and deeper, darker themes. She is dealing with themes of treachery, loss, etc.. All things that are usually dealt with in adult novels, but glossed over in YA fiction. While the literary pedant in me will sometimes cringe at her numerous clich\u00e9s, there still exists a place where I'm able to ignore the rough patches that a good editor might have corrected, but these are small peeves; similar to the irritations I feel for Star Wars. Speaking of Star Wars, THIS would be JK Rowling's 'Empire Strikes Back.' The best in the series.",
